# Compound Interest Calculator

This is a simple compound interest calculator built using React in TypeScript.
Charts are created using d3.js library. 

A bit of overkill but the state is managed by zustand.

# Thoughts

d3.js is an extensive library and gives a lot to work with. The amount of freedom it provides is amazing in my experience, but also a bit overwhelming at start.

This also meant, there are a lot of TS errors which I couldn't fix in the d3 code which I intend to fix sometime later.
